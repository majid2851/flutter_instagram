# Flutter Instagram App


## Description
Introduction to Riverpod
Riverpod is a state management library for Flutter applications, designed to make it easy to work with and manage the application state in a robust and scalable way. It is developed by the same team behind the popular Flutter framework.

Key Features
Provider-based Architecture: Riverpod is built on the concept of providers, which are used to expose and consume application state. Providers in Riverpod are flexible and composable, allowing you to create a hierarchy of providers that represent different parts of your application.

Immutable and Reactive State: Riverpod encourages the use of immutable state and follows a reactive programming model. This means that when the state changes, any widgets that depend on that state will automatically rebuild, ensuring that your UI stays up-to-date with the latest application state.

Scoped Providers: Riverpod introduces the concept of scoped providers, allowing you to create providers that are specific to a particular part of your widget tree. This helps in organizing and managing state in a modular and efficient manner.

Dependency Injection: Riverpod provides a built-in dependency injection system, making it easy to inject dependencies into your providers. This helps in decoupling different parts of your application and promotes a more testable and maintainable codebase.
